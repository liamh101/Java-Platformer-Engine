# Java-Platformer-Engine
A video game engine built in Java to be able to build and play a platformer game in the style of Mega-Man or Mario. 

My first attempt to build a video game Engine/Framework. I wrote the engine in Java to help me understand how game engines
work and to easily port to android. All code was written by me.
